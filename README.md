## 1. Introduction
This project analyzes an e-commerce website's dataset using SQL and Google BigQuery. The dataset provides insights into website traffic, user behavior, and e-commerce transactions. The primary objective is to uncover actionable insights to enhance website performance, improve user experience, and optimize sales.

## 2. Objectives
The project aims to:
- Understand traffic sources and user behavior patterns.  
- Analyze e-commerce performance metrics such as revenue, conversions, and product sales.  
- Perform cohort analysis to identify conversion trends and user retention.  
- Provide data-driven recommendations for improving e-commerce business strategies.

## 3. Dataset Overview
### 3.1 Importing the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the public Google Analytics sample dataset available on BigQuery:  
`bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`  

This dataset contains website session data from an e-commerce store, including traffic source information, user interactions, and e-commerce transactions. 

### 3.2 Dataset Description
The dataset is structured as follows:
- **Session-level Data**: Fields like `fullVisitorId`, `visitId`, `date`, and `trafficSource` provide information about each user session.
- **Hit-level Data**: Nested fields contain details of individual interactions (hits) during a session, such as pageviews, events, and transactions.
- **Product-level Data**: Nested fields include information about products viewed or purchased during transactions, such as `productName`, `productRevenue`, and `productQuantity`.

## 4. Data Processing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Preprocessed data to handle nested and repeated fields using `UNNEST` in SQL.
- Explored key metrics such as total sessions, revenue, and traffic sources to gain an initial understanding of the data.
- Performed data cleaning and filtering to focus on relevant e-commerce transactions.
